## AVOID PUSHING .o and .d FILES!! ALSO ANY EXECUTABLE YOU MAKE!!

---

## Work Division:
- **Alim** - Item and its classes
- **Luka** - Enemy and its classes
- **Sunae** - Player and the rest of the classes

---

## Notes:
- The action line should be implemented within the `action` method by calling `setCommandLine` after creating the appropriate string.

---

## Things to Do:

### **Player Mechanics**
- Player ability must be applied correctly
- Proper generation order (IN PROGRESS)

### **Enemy Class**
- Enemy generation
- Enemy random movement ("Note that enemies should be moved in a line-by-line fashion")
- Hoard spawns
- Merchant/Dragon specific behavior
- Player vs Enemy battle mechanics
- Enemy character display in `Tile` class
